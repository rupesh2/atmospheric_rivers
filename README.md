# Atmospheric Rivers

The [atmospheric rivers](https://ghrc.nsstc.nasa.gov/home/micro-articles/atmospheric-rivers) are narrow, elongated corridors of concentrated moisture transport associated with extratropical cyclones. Atmospheric rivers are the largest transport mechanisms of freshwater on Earth. The 2022 - 2023 winter season brought unrelenting precipitation to California via exceptionally strong atmospheric rivers, carrying moisture from the tropics up to the poles.
